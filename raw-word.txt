Khang Starr – Making Hot Sauce – Simple 15 Minutes Recipe (Youtube) 
Not Fermented 

Ingredients: 

1 x Large Bell Pepper (orange/yellow - depending on colour of sauce you want) 

3 large cloves of Garlic 

1-2 teaspoons of Sugar (depending on your taste) 

1 teaspoon Salt 

¼ cup White Vinegar 

4 or 5 superhot peppers 

Can add a few other peppers, like Scarlet Rose (1-2 for sweetness), or Lemon Starburst (like 2) 

Note: Make sauce, leave at least over night before using 

Steps: 

Remove seeds from bell pepper 

Put in blender: 

Bell pepper that was cut into smaller pieces 

Prepared superhots (with some other peppers if you want) 

You can remove some placenta from some superhots, since it can give a bitter taste 

Add the other peppers if you want, like Scarlet Rose, or Lemon Starburst 

3 Cloves Garlic 

 1 teaspoon of salt 

1-2 teaspoons of sugar, depending on how much sweetness you want 

 ¼ cup of white vinegar 

Blend everything as fine as possible 

Put blended sauce in a pot 

Cook slowly at low heat 

Stir constantly once it starts to bubble so that everything dissolves evenly 

This will thicken sauce. If you want thicker sauce, cook longer 

As soon as it starts to bubble, stir for a couple minutes and it’s already enough 

Aim for a ketchup consistency 

Wait for sauce to cool, and bottle 

Pour in bottle and that’s it 

Conservation:  
Not specified, but shouldn’t be very long

Blend peppers all together with salt. Get peppers as small as you can. 

Put peppers in jar, but keep the sides of the jar clean (or clean it up later) to avoid mold growth

Ex: If you have 800ml of mash, add 1000ml of white vinegar 

Emulsify vinegar with mash (using his mixer thing, if you want)
