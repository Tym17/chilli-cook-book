# Simple 15 Minute Recipe - Khang Starr

Sauce Type: Not Fermented

### Ingredients:
- 4-5 x Superhot Peppers 
- 1 x Large Bell Pepper (orange/yellow - depending on colour of sauce you want) 
- 3 x Large Garlic Cloves 
- ¼ Cup White Vinegar 
- 1-2 Teaspoons Sugar (depending on your taste) 
- 1 Teaspoon Salt 

Optional:
Can add a few other peppers, like 
 - 1-2 x Scarlet Rose for sweetness, and/or 
 - 2 x Lemon Starburst

Note: Make sauce, leave at least over night before using 

### Steps: 
1. Remove seeds from bell pepper 
2. Put in blender: 
    * Bell pepper that was cut into smaller pieces 
    * Prepared superhots (with some other peppers if you want) 
        * You can remove some placenta from some superhots, since it can give a bitter taste 
    * Add the other peppers if you want, like Scarlet Rose, or Lemon Starburst 
    * 3 x Cloves Garlic 
    * 1 teaspoon of salt 
    * 1-2 teaspoons of sugar, depending on how much sweetness you want 
    * ¼ cup of white vinegar 
3. Blend everything as fine as possible 
4. Put blended sauce in a pot 
    * Cook slowly at low heat 
    * Stir constantly once it starts to bubble so that everything dissolves evenly 
    * This will thicken sauce. If you want thicker sauce, cook longer 
    * As soon as it starts to bubble, stir for a couple minutes and it’s already enough 
    * Aim for a ketchup consistency 
5. Wait for sauce to cool, and bottle 
    * Pour in bottle and that’s it 

### Conservation:  
Not specified, but shouldn’t be very long
