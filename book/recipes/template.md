[comment]: <> (Acceptable values: "Not Fermented", "Brine Fermentation", or "Mash Fermentation")
##### Sauce Type:
Not Fermented

[comment]: <> (
Style Notes:
- List peppers at the top of the list, in order from the largest quantity to the smallest
- Afterwards, list ingredients from the largest quantity to the smallest.
-- Exception:
--- Try to keep related ingredients together. For example, try to keep spices together, and at the bottom of the list, regardless of the rule to list ingredients by quantity.
- Write measurements completely -> i.e. 1 Cup, instead of 1cu, or 1 Teaspoon instead of 1tsp
- Capitalize all ingredients -> Light Brown Sugar, instead of light brown sugar..
-- Exception:
--- small words like 'in', 'of', 'a' -> Peaches in Heavy Syrup,
--- non-ingredients -> 'seeded and chopped'
- Write in fractions -> 1/2 instead of 0.5
- Use "x" to show multiple quantities -> "12 x Habanero peppers" instead of "12 Habanero peppers"
