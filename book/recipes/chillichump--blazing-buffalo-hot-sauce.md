# Blazing Buffalo Hot Sauce – ChilliChump  

Sauce Type: Mash Fermentation

### Ingredients (Normal Hot):
- 580g Cayenne Peppers (70%)
- 250g Ring of Fire Peppers (30%)
- 2 x 7 Pot Habaneros
- 1L White Vinegar (about 1.25x amount compared to fermented mash volume)
- 20g Salt (bit more than 2% WRT peppers weight)
- 1 Tablespoon Garlic Powder

Optional:
 - 1 x 7 Pot Primo for more heat 

### Ingredients (Very Hot):
- 65% Ring of Fire Peppers  
- 35% Cayenne Peppers 
- 4 x 7 Pot Habaneros  
- White Vinegar (about 1.25x amount compared to fermented mash volume)
- 2+% Salt  
- 2-3 Tablespoons Garlic powder (more than in normal heat, so it comes through) 

### Steps: 
1. Chop up all peppers loosely (going to blend it anyways) 
2. Blend peppers all together with salt. Get peppers as small as you can. 
3. Put peppers in jar, but keep the sides of the jar clean (or clean it up later) to avoid mold growth 
    * Add lid and airlock 
4. Leave to ferment for 6 weeks. 
    * Should have no growth on top, just nice and red 
5. After fermentation is complete:
    * Add about 1.25x white vinegar compared to volume of pepper mash 
    * Ex: If you have 800ml of mash, add 1000ml of white vinegar 
6. Emulsify vinegar with mash (using his mixer thing, if you want) 
7. Filter the sauce through a sieve 
8. Pour into bottles. It’s shelf stable! 

Note: Keep the stuff that you filtered out, you can freeze it in ice cube trays, or dry it

### Conservation:  
Shelf Stable
